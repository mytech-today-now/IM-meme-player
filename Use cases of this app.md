*Use cases of this app*:
- Similar to a TV broadcast channel,  in the sense that you could create a 24-hour-long playlist of videos and programming similar to a television broadcast channel.
- Similar to ChatSnap,  in the sense that you can take pictures of your life. And turn them into a ready-made media stream. [ This would be the reason why we would want APIs so that we can have other applications programmatically add items to playlists.  Or to view playlists.]
- Similar to a Media Kit for a company,  in the sense that each item in the playlist could be an individual item of media for the company,  logos,  fonts,  videos,  etc.
- Similar to an onboarding process for a new employee,  in the sense that the employee could be sent a link to a playlist,  And embedded in the playlist would be HTML forms surrounded by content about the company,  In the form of text,  images,  and video. [ This use case would be assuming that we could have regular old HTML content in the playlist item,  Such as text or forms.]
